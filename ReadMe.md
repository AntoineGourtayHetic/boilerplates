## Application Boilerplates

This repo contains a collection of "boilerplate applications". These are  minimal and ready-to-run node.js applications designed to get you from zero to deployed in minutes.

## Installation

### Install jitsu ( helps manage your node apps )

    npm install jitsu -g

## Installing boilerplates

    jitsu install <name>

*where `name` is the name of any included boilerplate*

## Included Boilerplates

```
jitsu install dnode
jitsu install express
jitsu install socket.io

```

## Usage

After running `jitsu install <appname>`, you will be prompted to start the application locally. After testing the application locally, you can then deploy it to the cloud using the `jitsu deploy` command.

For additional information, each individual boilerplate folder contains it's own `ReadMe.md` file.
